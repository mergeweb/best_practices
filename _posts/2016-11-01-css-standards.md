This document is a working draft.

##Purpose
The purpose of this document will be to define some standardized best practices for how our CSS is composed and organized in our projects.

##Goals
The Goals of Drupal 8's CSS philosophy will serve as a good starting point for our CSS philosophy. Well-architected CSS should be:

###1: Predictable
CSS should be consistent and understandable within one project and accross multiple projects. This applies to naming structure, organization of files and the way styles are separated into different parts.
 
###2: Maintainable
It should be easy to append, update and modify the existing codebase with new modules and features without breaking existing styles.

###3: Scalable
The same approach should function well in both small and large projects.
